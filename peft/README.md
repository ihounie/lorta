    <p> Tensor Low rank adapters (LoRTA) implementation using HF's PEFT</p>
</h3>

PEFT is integrated with Transformers for easy model training and inference, Diffusers for conveniently managing different adapters, and Accelerate for distributed training and inference for really big models.

I have modified LoRA (`src/peft/tuners/lora`) to implement Low Rank Tensor Adapters (LoRTA). It can be found in `src/peft/tuners/lorta` folder.

Migrating a training script from LoRa to LorTA should be as easy as changing `LoraConfig` by `LorTaConfig` and using 
`LorTaLayer` (from peft.tuners.lorta) instead of `LoraLayer` (from peft.tuners.lora).

In so far I have tested it with LLAMA-2-7B on Alpaca, when finetuning all linear modules at each layer ('q_proj', 'k_proj', 'v_proj', 'o_proj'), and roberta-base in GLUE using experiment scripts from the [VeRA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11454) openreview submission, found in the folder `instruct` and `glue`.

Supporting other models and tasks might require updating the `TRANSFORMERS_MODELS_TO_LORTA_QKVO_MAPPING` and `TRANSFORMERS_MODELS_TO_LORTA_TARGET_MODULES_MAPPING` in `src/peft/utils/constants.py`.

## Quickstart

Install PEFT locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

Try an example:
    
```bash
cd instruct
./lora_llama2_7b.sh
```
